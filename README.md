# Sensor_System_Proj
This repository showcases client-side software for a sensor detection and display tool development project.

The entire client software comprises four menu pages, each containing multiple submenus. Specific menu functions are as follows:

1. Device Management: Supports adding, deleting, and customizing sensor device configurations. Information automatically synchronizes to the system backend for binding data to 3D models.
2. 3D Models: Supports simulation of six forklift types using factory-designed models, with rapid expansion via the Add Model menu. Models synchronize with real sensor operations, enabling sensor input functions defined by configuration and action simulation on 3D models. Users can also manually control model movements.
3. Data Analysis: This menu contains two submenusâ€”Data Acquisition and Statistical Analysis. Data Acquisition displays real-time data collected from hardware devices and automatically detects anomalies to trigger alerts. Statistical Analysis enables one-click access to historical data tables and facilitates comparative analysis for manual verification. It also integrates data filtering for adaptive cleaning and anomaly removal.
4. System Settings: This menu handles basic client software configuration, including appearance, window size, and account management. It also provides permission settings, enabling the assignment of distinct operational privileges to different users to effectively safeguard client data security.
